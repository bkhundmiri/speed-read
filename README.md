# Speed Read

## Project Description

If you're a part of the generation invested in technology and the advances it brings, you'll notice that sometimes, something as old school as reading a book, seems extremely out of touch. In the age of Google and Wikipidea, there is no lack of information. But the actual act of reading has yet to evolve. This app revolutionizes the primitive way of reading and trains your cognative ability to comprehend words at a faster rate. Statistically speaking, learning something is done most effectively at 200 words per min, understanding at 400 words per min, and revising at 600 words per min. Speed Read lets you control the flow of information, suited and customized to your needs and abilities.

content: "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters. “My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?” Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. “But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.” Mr. Bennet made no answer. “Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife impatiently. “You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.” This was invitation enough. “Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.” “What is his name?” “Bingley.”...

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

Going into this project I know my strengths are going to be the design and content placement aspects. I have a mental picture of what exactly my application
will look like so i know I wont falter too much on where and what I'd like to do. 

### Weaknesses:

My last project, I had finished functionality within the first day but for this project I'd like to work on the JavaScript portion. I chose a specifially difficult functionality to do just this. I have a fair sense on how I'm going to work around hurdles I might encounter but I'm looking forward to learning new tricks.

### Opportunities:

This project will mold me into a better JavaScript coder. The problems I have a faint idea that I will face will definetly improve and harden my resourcefulness and problem solving skills.

### Threats:

There are certain things that before starting this project i feel like i will get stuck on. The display of words one at a time from a paragraph pulled from the Airtable will be tough. But JavaScript functionality aside, I know I will overcome it.
