# PROJECT ISSUE TICKET

## Unexpected Behavior

React's double rendering is conflicting with the setinterval and is pulling 2 words instead of one whenever the interval is called. I also cannot figure out how to stop the display of words with clearSetInterval because of scoping issues.

## Expected Behavior

When a play button is pressed, a single word from the array of words is printed in a <div/> on screen every 200 miliseconds.

## Reproduce the Error

> Describe the steps we can take to reproduce the error, i.e.:

```md
1. clone
2. run start
3. click on "Read" button on nav
4. Endless display of words double rendered with no stop
```
